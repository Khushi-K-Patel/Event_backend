Project Idea: Event Management Platform

Description:
Create an event management platform where users can create, discover, and manage events. The application should have the following features:

User Authentication: Implement user authentication using JWT to allow users to sign up, log in, and log out. Store user information securely.

Event Listing: Display a list of upcoming events with details such as event title, date, time, location, description, and organizer information. Retrieve event data from a MongoDB database.

Event Search and Filtering: Enable users to search for events based on keywords, location, date, or category. Implement advanced filtering options to narrow down search results.

Event Creation: Allow event organizers to create and publish events. Provide a form where they can enter event details, upload images, set ticket prices (if applicable), and specify event categories.

Event Registration and Ticketing: Enable users to register for events and purchase tickets (if applicable). Implement a secure payment integration using a payment gateway such as Stripe.

Event Management: Provide event organizers with a dashboard to manage their events. Allow them to view attendee lists, send event updates, and track ticket sales.

User Profiles: Each user should have a profile page displaying their registered events, ticket history, and event preferences. Allow users to edit and update their profiles.

Event Reminders: Send email or push notifications to users as event reminders, providing event details and any updates.

Event Ratings and Reviews: Allow users to rate and review events they have attended. Display average ratings and user reviews on event pages.

Social Sharing: Implement social sharing functionality to allow users to share events on social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter.

Event Recommendations: Provide personalized event recommendations based on user preferences, past event attendance, or similar events attended by other users.

Responsive Design: Ensure that the application is responsive and provides a seamless user experience across different devices and screen sizes.

Building an event management platform using the MERN stack will allow you to explore user interactions, ticketing systems, payment integrations, and personalized recommendations. It's an exciting project that can bring together event organizers and attendees in one centralized platform.
